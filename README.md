# API Credentials

TODO.

# Allow users to use this feature.
Zendesk does not allow normal users (*end-users*) to use the API if their e-mail is not verified, to verify an user email we need to head to Zendesk panel and find the user we want to verify, at the user panel we can see the user's email and a flag which warns us that the current user email is not verified yet, at the image below you can see how to verify:

![Verify](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37507878/email.png "Verify")

After that the user can use the API properly.
